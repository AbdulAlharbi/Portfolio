# My Portfolio of Projects

Welcome to my multi-project repository! Here you'll find four distinct projects showcasing various programming languages and concepts:

1. **Bank Account System** (`C++`)  
   A demonstration of object-oriented programming in C++ using classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.  
   - [BankAccountSystem/](BankAccountSystem)

2. **x86 Assembly: Stacks and Overflow** (`Assembly`)  
   A low-level project demonstrating buffer usage, syscall handling, and simple functions in x86-64 assembly on Linux.  
   - [StacksOverflowAsm/](StacksOverflowAsm)

3. **Tic Tac Toe** (`Python`)  
   A simple GUI game built with Python’s `tkinter` library to illustrate game logic, user interaction, and basic 2D board management.  
   - [TicTacToePython/](TicTacToePython)

4. **Chess Game** (`Java`)  
   A Swing-based GUI chess game with a simplified AI opponent. Demonstrates object-oriented design, game rules, and a basic AI approach.  
   - [ChessGameJava/](ChessGameJava)

5. **Pomodoro_Timer** (`html, css, js`)  
   A fully featured Pomodoro Timer page designed to help students and tutors stay productive and on-task. Perfect as a stand-alone tool or integrated into LessonConnect’s broader platform, CS472 Spring 25' 2025.
